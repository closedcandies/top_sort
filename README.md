Hello. This simple consol app will help you with topological sort.
All you need to do is:
1) create a file with following format:
   N (int) - amount of nodes
   M (int) - amount of edges
   Node1 (any) - name of node 1
   Node2 (any) - name of node 2
   ... - N lines
   Node1->Node2 - edge between nodes
   ... - M lines

   Ex:
   5
   5
   Node1
   Node2
   Node3
   Node4
   Node5
   Node1->Node2
   Node2->Node3
   Node3->Node4
   Node4->Node5
   Node5->Node1

3) start an app. Please, write the name of your file as an argument in command line
   Ex: ./main filename.txt
